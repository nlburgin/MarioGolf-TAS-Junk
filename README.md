miscellania for TASing mario golf

Most of it is not in very presentable shape. Some of it has weird copy-paste artifacts, particularly comments that are documenting something else entirely (despite claiming to be for luck manipulation on wind, the "ploppyscript" line are all variants on twiddling the strike zone for entertainment value).

TBH I'm mainly keeping it here as a backup.

If anyone is seriously interested in collaboration, file an issue. I'll *probably* do it all myself and I'm not even sure why I'm making all this stuff public, but if anyone wants to try using/building on this work then it would probably be better if we worked together.
